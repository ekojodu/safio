						<img

						<p class="right">
							A tax return is a document that you fill out to tell the
							government how much money you made and how much tax you should
							pay. A tax return is a form filed with a government body,
							reporting income, expenses, and other pertinent tax information.
							Taxpayers use tax returns to calculate their tax liability,
							schedule tax payments, or request refunds for overpayment of
							taxes. The primary purpose of a tax return is to provide the
							government with information about your financial activities over a
							specific period, typically a year. It helps the government know if
							you need to pay more taxes or if they owe you a refund.
						</p>
						<p class="left">
							Filing tax returns is a fundamental responsibility with numerous
							benefits tailored to different audiences. Understanding these
							advantages can help individuals, small business owners, and
							investors optimize their financial outcomes and ensure compliance
							with tax laws. Whether you are filing for the first time or
							managing complex financial activities, recognizing the importance
							and benefits of tax returns is crucial for financial well-being.
